## Quantum Information Science Overview

### Quantum Sensing
Quantum sensing leverages the unique properties of quantum states, such as superposition and entanglement, to enhance the sensitivity and precision of measurements. Our work focuses on photonic quantum sensors that push the boundaries of detecting signals at the ultimate limits set by quantum mechanics.

### Quantum Communication
Harnessing quantum mechanics, we are developing secure and efficient communication methods that go beyond classical limits. Quantum communication ensures data privacy through techniques like quantum key distribution, enabling unprecedented levels of security in information transfer.
