subtitle: Optimizing Entanglement to attain Quantum Limit of Long-Baseline Imaging
---

This project addresses fundamental research on one of the potentially-strongest use-cases of distributed entanglement---that of enhancing the performance of a network of sensors trying to work together to solve one task---specifically in the context of long-baseline imaging. This ambitious project brings together two lines of research our group has led in recent years--receiver designs to attain quantum limits of passive imaging (funded primarily by DARPA), and entanglement-enhanced photonic sensors (funded primarily by ONR)---to develop a thorough fundamental understanding, and practical system designs, for entanglement enhanced long-baseline imaging at the quantum-performance limit. Our research objectives are broken into three tasks, as described below.

- Task 1 - Entanglement assisted general distributed parameter estimation: We explore the use of distributed multi-site entanglement and local quantum operations and measurements, and classical communications among sensor sites, to attain the quantum limits of estimation accuracy of any predefined parameter that is a global function of the locally-collected light by the sensors. This theory is then applied to find the specific entanglement necessary and the local operations and classical communications (LOCC) algorithms, to attain -- for long-baseline imaging -- a recently-quantified fundamental quantum limit, for a general passive imaging parameter detection and estimation task involving incoherent broadband radiation, by a long-baseline telescope system (of given telescope diameters and baseline geometry) in the traditionally unresolvable sub-Rayleigh regime.

- Task 2 - Practical design and performance evaluation of entanglement enhanced long-baseline interferometric imaging: We will design a system that approaches the quantum limit evaluated in Task 1 -- for passive imaging problems of interest to the USAF -- such as discriminating prior-known objects under dimly-lit conditions with applications to GEO object detection and earth-based remote sensing -- but with that system built with readily available quantum technology, e.g., spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC)-based photonic entanglement sources, Silicon vacancy color-center based quantum memories [being built for quantum repeater development for long-distance entanglement distribution as part of the NSF-ERC Center for Quantum Networks (CQN)], volumetric spatial mode sorters (being designed and built in our group using a spatial light modulator (SLM)), optical fibers, switches, and shot-noise-limited single photon detectors. This task will quantify, for real-life imaging and object detection/estimation problems, how much actual improved performance could an entanglement-assisted system afford, as compared with a traditional interferometric-based long-baseline imaging system.

- Task 3 - Experimental proof-of-concept validation of concept: In this task, we will demonstrate, time and resources permitting, quantum enhanced multi-aperture image-data detection and estimation, in a proof-of-concept emulated laboratory experiment, for a two-aperture setting for a simple problem such as estimating the angular separation between two pointlike incoherent emitters. This experiment will employ SLM-based mode sorters we have built, and a programmable nanophotonic linear-optical processor attached to a HG-basis mode sorter purchased from CaiLabs.
