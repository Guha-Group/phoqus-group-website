Our group investigates mathematical foundations, applications, and experimental system designs for attaining quantum precision limits of photonic information processing.

Our work entails applications where light is used to extract, carry and process information. Examples include: (1) designing codes and quantum-enhanced receivers for optical fiber and free-space classical communications, (2) quantum communications and associated research questions surrounding quantum repeaters, network architectures, interfaces between photons and quantum memories and quantum error correction codes, (3) use of non-classical light sources in photonic sensing systems such as radars, LIDARs, fiber-optic gyroscopes, scanning-probe microscopes etc., (4) systems and methods to approach quantum-limited resolution of passive imaging systems with applications in astronomy, microscopy, and spectral imaging, as well as (5) special-purpose computations using quantum states of light.

We are interested in developing new insights into quantum information and estimation theories, evaluating fundamental performance limits governed by the laws of physics by treating information-bearing light as a quantum mechanical object, and in designing, evaluating and building proof-of-concept systems in our laboratory that aim to approach such quantum-limited performance. Our research often involves innovations cross-cutting multiple disciplines such as information theory, quantum optics, physics of atomic systems, error correction theory, and network theory.
