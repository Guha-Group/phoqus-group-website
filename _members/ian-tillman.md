I graduated from Coe College in May 2018 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science. During my time at Coe I researched and published on manufacturing high-density scintillating glass with properties that are useful for medical imaging detectors. In the fall of 2018 I joined the University of Arizona College of Optical Sciences as a PhD student and started working with Dr. Dan Kilper researching classical optical networks, pivoting to quantum optical networks in 2020 with Dr. Saikat Guha. Since then I have been focused on both experimental and theoretical research involved with realizing the Quantum Internet. I'm most interested in continuous variable quantum information theory, specifically the performance of quantum repeaters and switches within quantum networks.
