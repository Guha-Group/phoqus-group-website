Freddy holds a B.A. in Physics and Mathematics from Amherst College. His academic background spans quantum optics, nonlinear photonics, and integrated quantum systems. At the University of Maryland, he is currently working on two projects involving pulsed squeezed light sources and soliton dynamics in dispersion-engineered platforms for optical communications.
Outside of research, Freddy is the founder of Quantum Hub, a first-of-its-kind emerging initiative focused on community building and education in quantum science across his native Peru and Latin America. He also enjoys writing and mentoring students, with a broader interest in projects that combine creativity with impact.
