Freddy holds a B.A. in Physics and Mathematics from Amherst College. His academic background spans quantum optics, nonlinear photonics, and integrated quantum systems. At the University of Maryland, he is currently working on two projects involving pulsed squeezed-light sources with microring frequency combs and soliton dynamics in dispersion-engineered platforms for optical communications.

Outside of research, Freddy is the CEO & Founder of QuantumHub Peru, Latin Americaâ€™s first structured quantum education pipeline. Beyond its selective academic cohorts, his non-profit develops edtech apps and conducts data-driven macroeconomic studies on regional quantum readiness. Their ultimate goal: integrate quantum computing into high school and college STEM curricula.

In his spare time, Freddy loves to play chess, write novels, and travel.
