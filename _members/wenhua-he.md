Wenhua He was a PhD student at the James C. Wyant College of Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona, working with Prof. Guha. Her PhD dissertation (completed in 2024) studied various aspects of classical and quantum structured and spatially entangled probes of light for near-field sensing problems, including applications to quantum optomechanics. Her research interests span both the theoretical foundations of continuous-variable and discrete-variable entanglement-assisted detection and parameter estimation, as well as experimental designs of photonic sensor systems with a focus on diffractive optics. After graduation, she worked on photonic crystal cavity design as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Optical Sciences with Prof. Matt Eichenfield.

Currently, she is a Postdoctoral Associate in ECE with Prof. Saikat Guha.
