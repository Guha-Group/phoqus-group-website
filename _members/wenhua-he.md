Wenhua He received her Bachelor of Engineering degree from Tianjin University in 2015. From there she completed her Masters degree at the University of Rochester in 2018. She was a PhD student at the James C. Wyant College of Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona, working with Prof. Guha. Her PhD dissertation (completed in 2024) studied various aspects of classical and quantum structured and spatially-entangled probes of light for near-field sensing problems including applications to opto-mechanics. Her research interests span both theoretical foundations of continuous variable entanglement assisted detection and parameter estimation, as well as experimental designs of photonic sensor systems.

Wenhua He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in Optical Sciences working with Prof. Matt Eichenfield.
