Zhifan Zhou is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Maryland. His research lies at the intersection of quantum optics and integrated photonics, with a focus on chip-scale generation and control of nonclassical light (squeezing and quantum entanglement) using microresonators and optical frequency combs. He is particularly interested in frequency- and spatial-mode multiplexed photonic states, including photonic cluster states, and their applications in quantum sensing, quantum information processing, and precision measurement
