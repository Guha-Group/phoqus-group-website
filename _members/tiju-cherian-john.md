I am a Fulbright alumnus, and also serves an editor for the journal, Complex Analysis and Operator Theory. My primary area of expertise centers around mathematics of quantum theory, with a specific focus on challenges stemming from quantum information theory. My research pursuits span the interdisciplinary landscape of quantum information theory, quantum probability, and operator theory. Within the academic realm, I am actively engaged in teaching an advanced course on optical sciences called `Information in a Photon', and also work as the Technical Lead for the engineering workforce development activities at the NSF Engineering Research Center, Center for Quantum Networks.
