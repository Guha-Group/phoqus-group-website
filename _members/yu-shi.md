I obtained a PhD from the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Maryland. My current research interests focus on entanglement distillation protocols, quantum metrology, and characterizing noise in quantum systems. I am dedicated to promoting the understanding of the quantum world and bringing new technologies to society.
