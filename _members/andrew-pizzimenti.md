Research: Andrew is currently interested in developing novel non-Guassiantiy measures and Bayesian tomographic techniques for characterizing non-Gaussian photonic states. He hopes to employ these characterization tools to design systems that efficiently produce non-Gaussian photonic states useful for quantum information processing.
