I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Maryland. I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Arizona. My research focuses on quantum sensing and quantum communication. I hope my theoretical work is both mathematically rigorous and experimentally feasible
