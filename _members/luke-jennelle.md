My name is Luke Jennelle, I grew up in Bluefield, VA and I am a rising senior majoring in physics at Radford University. I am currently working with PhD student Joohyung Song on the characterization of silicon vacancy color centers in diamond. My interests include robotics, computer engineering, and quantum computing. I was a part of a team that competed in the MATE ROV underwater robotics world championship two years in a row. Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, drawing, fishing, and watching football.
