Declan Daly is a PhD student who worked with Prof. Ron Walsworth at UMD on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of samples using Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. With dynamical decoupling sequences, NVs can be made sensitive to oscillating magnetic fields from
nearby spins, e.g., NMR signals of small numbers of nuclei near the diamond surface. Declan is currently working in Prof. Saikat Guha's group, in collaboration with others with expertise in super-resolution imaging, and entanglement among diamond-vacancy emitters, to explore system designs whose sensitivities could approach the quantum limits of sensing information embedded in weak spatio-temporal varying magnetic fields signals.
