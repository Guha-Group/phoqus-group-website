Received my B.S and M.S in optical science and engineering from the Wyant college of Optical Sciences at the Uniersity of Arizona. During my academic career I had 4 internships. 2 internships with Lockheed Martin in which I worked on the research and development of an interferometric flat space telescope, one internship with MKS (Spectra Physics), in which I worked on a white light interferometer and one with Applied Materials in which I looked into the quantum networking market lanscape to see where the company can fit within this growing market. My research focuses on utilizing spatial mode sorting to imrove the performance of hard imaging tasks in the super resolution regime.
