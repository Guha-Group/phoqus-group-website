Zacharie was a post-doctoral researcher with the group from 2022-2024. Zacharie studied Physical Engineering at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles. He received his PhD in 2021 from the Centre for Quantum Information and Communication (QuIC, ULB, Brussels). He is now a postdoctoral visiting scholar at OSC with a BAEF fellowship. His research interests lie at the intersection of quantum information and quantum optics. In particular, his work has been focused on the characterization of quantum uncertainty from the phase-space representation of quantum mechanics. This is strongly linked to notions such as Wigner functions, majorization theory and entropic uncertainty relations.
