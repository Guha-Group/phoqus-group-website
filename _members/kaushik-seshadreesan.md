Dr. Kaushik Seshadreesan obtained his PhD in Physics from Louisiana State University under the supervision of Jonathan P. Dowling, and co-supervision of Hwang Lee and Mark M. Wilde. Kaushik then held postdoctoral positions at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, and the Wyant College of Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona. He then also held a Research Scientist position at the University of Arizona before joining Pitt in fall 2021. Kaushik earned an M.Sc. in Physics and B.E. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India.

Kaushikâ€™s research broadly lies in quantum information science and technologies, spanning quantum information theory, quantum sensing, quantum communications, and quantum computation. He is currently primarily interested in quantum communication networks. As quantum technologies continue to grow and mature, interconnecting quantum gadgets such as quantum sensors or quantum computers is key to realizing their full potential. This requires the ability to communicate quantum information reliably and efficiently over such quantum networks. Kaushik is interested in addressing research questions and challenges that lie across the different layers of a full quantum networking stack towards realizing the future quantum internet.
