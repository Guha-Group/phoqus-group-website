Michael Grace received a BS in Physics from Yale University with a focus in biophysics. He subsequently worked at the Yale School of Medicine on high speed super-resolution microscopy (PALM/STORM) implementation. After transitioning to optics at OSC, Michaelâ€™s work has focused on the quantum limits of sub-Rayleigh imaging using optical pre-processing techniques. He is interested in using quantum optics, information theory and image science to help bridge the gap between theoretical ideas and realistic technologies in areas such as bioimaging and communications. He graduated with his PhD from The University of Arizona in December 2022.
