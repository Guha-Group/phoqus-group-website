Cat received her Bachelor of Science from the University of Arizona in Physics & Astronomy with a minor in Mathematics. During my undergraduate studies, she completed a variety of research projects on extragalactic astrophysics, experimental biophysics, astronomy instrumentation, and planetary science. Following her graduation, she accepted a position as a middle school math teacher in Wilder, Idaho. She came back to the University of Arizona to complete a Master of Science in Optical Sciences, during which time she started working with Prof. Saikat Guha's group, under the guidance of Dr. Allison Rubenok, on building a super-resolution imaging setup using a Hermite-Gauss-basis spatial mode sorter. This experiment, designed for astronomical imaging, has led Cat to pursue a deep PhD career in astronomical image science working with Prof. Ewan Douglas at the Steward Observatory, University of Arizona.
