Dr. Eneet Kaur is a Quantum Research Scientist at Cisco. She was a 
Research Scientist in Prof. Guha's group at Wyant College of Optical Sciences, where she worked on various problems surrounding analyzing the effects of link infidelity in GHZ-projection based quantum networking protocols, and resource efficient preparation of photonic graph states using quantum emitters and their applications to quantum repeaters. Eneet did postdoctoral research with Prof. Norbert Lutkenhaus at IQC prior to that, working on continuous variable quantum communications research, and earned a PhD degree at LSU working with Prof. Mark Wilde on problems in finite length quantum information theory.
