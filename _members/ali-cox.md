Originally a physics major, Ali started working with Saikat after taking an interest in quantum information after spending a summer at Washington University simulating the state trajectories of a superconducting qubit under continuous weak measurement. He is currently working on solving a communication optimization problem on an optical channel and learning about quantum computing. In his free time, Ali likes to draw comics and hike.
