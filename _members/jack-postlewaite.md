Jack Postlewaite received his B.S. in Physics from the University of Wisconsin â€“ Madison in 2018. During his undergraduate studies, he engaged in research in both computational materials science and biophotonics instrumentation. In 2024 he earned an M.S. in Optical Sciences with an emphasis in Quantum Information Science and Engineering from the University of Arizona. Currently, Jack is pursuing a PhD in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, College of Engineering. 

Jack's research focuses on quantum communications, quantum information theory, and quantum computing. His current research focuses on experimental efforts to realize generalized temporal unitary control of single photon and squeezed coherent light. This work builds on previous experience realizing the first experimental demonstration of superadditive communication using an all optical joint detection receiver, useful for deep space optical communications. Jack's interests continue to involve quantum enhanced optical communication and sensing.
