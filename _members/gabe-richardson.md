I am from San Diego, CA and Provo, UT. As an undergraduate, I studied Physics at Brigham Young University and participated in the Pathways program at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. In this process, I developed a fascination with light which lead me to graduate studies at the University of Arizona in the College of Optical Sciences.   I am interested in the fundamental extraction and processing of information from light with applications to sensing, imaging, and computing. My current research includes entanglement generation and distribution, atomic or atom-like quantum memory design, and quantum long baseline interferometry.
