The 2026 Winter School on Quantum Networks, hosted by the Center for Quantum Networks, will take place from January 5th-9th and is open for registration. PhoQuS group members Saikat Guha, Gabe Richardson, and Jack Postlewaite will be instructors this year.

The goal of the Winter School is to provide introductory tutorials at all levels in topics that are new to the participants, who include CQN students, postdocs, faculty, CQN industry partners, other outside qualified persons (including students at non-CQN schools), and industry and government scientists.  

Each course is co-developed and co-taught by two people – a lead instructor and a co-instructor. Co-instructors are graduate students and postdocs. This arrangement, based on a program developed a decade ago by Michael Raymer and Judith Eisen (The Science Literacy Program at University of Oregon, https://scilit.uoregon.edu), has two purposes: to mentor students who wish to learn best practices in teaching under the mentorship of an experienced instructor, and to improve the quality of the short course by adopting best practices in inquiry-based teaching with the active participation of the co-instructor.

Getting up to Speed on Quantum Networks: Modes, States, Transformations and Measurements (Level 3)
Saikat Guha and Gabe Richardson
January 5, 2026 | 3:00PM - 6:30PM EST


Information in a Photon (Level 3-4)
Anthony Brady and Jack Postlewaite
January 6, 2026 | 11:00AM - 2:30PM EST

Information in a Photon is a level 3 course designed to provide an overview of the information theoretic properties of the quantum-limited regimes for optical communication. We will understand what optical communications is and the cutting edge applications such as deep space optical communications. Technical topics will cover the basics of modulation, detection, receiver design, classical and classical-quantum communication channels.
