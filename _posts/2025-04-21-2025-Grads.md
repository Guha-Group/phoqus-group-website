Four of our group's students: Wenhua He, Prajit Dhara, Ian Tillman, and Ashlesha Patil will be walking across the stage at the University of Arizona on May 15. These four students have done remarkable work in their field and will be awarded their PhD's this 2025 commencement. 

Wenhua He defended her thesis on "Harnessing the Spatial Degree of Freedom for Quantum Photonic Sensors." Ashlesha Patil defended her thesis on "Quantum Network Protocols and Architectures" and is now with PsiQuantum. Ian Tillman defended his thesis on "Continuous Variable Quantum Networks: A Layer Based Approach." And just earlier this month, Prajit Dhara defended his thesis on "Quantum Communications with Near Term Quantum Networks." 

Join us on May 15 as we celebrate these four bright individuals!
