The PhoQuS group is happy to announce our first semester as a team at the University of Maryland as a part of the Clark School of Engineering. We are launching this new group website to share information with the UMD community in beyond; covering our group research, projects, and general updates. Stay tuned over the coming months for more news about new funded projects and events.
