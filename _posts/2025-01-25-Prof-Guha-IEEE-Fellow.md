Clark Distinguished Chair Professor Saikat Guha has been named to the IEEE Fellow Class of 2025 for bridging information theory and physics to design quantum-enhanced photonic sensing, communications, and networking systems. Guha is appointed to the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and leads the University of Maryland Photonic Quantum Systems Group (PhoQuS).

Guha joined ECE in June 2024 from the University of Arizona, College of Optical Sciences. His expertise in the growing field of quantum information research has further expanded ECE’s focus in quantum engineering.

His research interests include quantum information and estimation theory, quantum communications, and photonic quantum computing, and focuses on fundamental performance limits when light is used to extract, carry and process information.

PhoQuS is a joint venture between the University of Maryland and the University of Arizona. The group’s research is based on three main areas: mathematical foundations of quantum information theory, quantum optics, and photonic information processing. Their multi-disciplinary work connects areas such as information theory, quantum optics, physics of atomic systems, error correction theory, and network theory.

Since joining ECE, Guha has brought a breadth of funded research projects in conjunction with a number of organizations, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), the National Science Foundation (NSF), RTX, and Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL) with the US Department of Energy (DoE),  

After receiving a degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in 2002, he earned a SM (2004) and PhD (2008) in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT. Prior to joining the University of Arizona in 2017, he was with BBN Technologies in Cambridge, MA from 2008-2017, where he was part of the founding team of BBN’s Quantum Information Processing Group.

As a highly recognized quantum scientist, Guha has been the recipient of numerous awards, including the Raytheon 2011 Excellence in Engineering and Technology Award, the 2023 Anita Jones Entrepreneurial Award from BBN Technologies, and the Raymie Stata Award for outstanding performance as a Teaching Assistant for Signals and Systems at MIT. He was a member of India’s first team to the International Physics Olympiad in Reykjavik in 1998, where he received an Honorable Mention and the European Physical Society (EPS) Award for the experimental component.
