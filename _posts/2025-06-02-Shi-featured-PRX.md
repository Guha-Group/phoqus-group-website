University of Maryland postdoc Yu Shi (ECE Ph.D. â€™23) has been published as first author in PRX Quantum, a physical review journal produced by the American Physical Society (APS). His research was completed in collaboration with Dr. Ashlesha Patil, a scientist at PsiQuantum under the guidance of UMD Clark Distinguished Chair Professor Saikat Guha.

The basis of the paper, titled Stabilizer Entanglement Distillation and Efficient Fault-Tolerant Encoders, provides a framework for code-based distillation of quantum entanglement.

Quantum entanglement is essential in quantum information processing, but it is a noise-sensitive resource. Through his research, Shi presented a method for applying classical error-correcting codes to quantum entanglement distillation. Additionally, Shi has developed a measurement-based method that reduces circuity depth for entanglement distillation protocols based on stabilizer codes. Building this framework is a vital component for efficient quantum communication and fault-tolerant computing.

A key innovation noted in the paper is a constant-depth decoder, which uses single-qubit measurements to transform logical qubits into physical ones. This results in streamlined entanglement distillation for advanced codes such as quantum convolutional and quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes.
