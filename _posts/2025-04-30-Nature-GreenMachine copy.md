Exciting research from our group—led by Dr. Chaohan Cui and PhD student Jack Postlewaite—was just recently published in the Nature Communications Journal! Their work presents the first experimental evidence of receiver-side superadditive communication capacity through joint detection. The realized receiver design offers a novel and scalable approach to implementing a Green Machine-type receiver. This design is also inherently resilient to channel phase noise without requiring a local oscillator. Together, these properties of superadditivity and phase noise resilience make it a strong contender for the design of near-term deep-space optical communication platforms.
